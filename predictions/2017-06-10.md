# Billy Meier’s 2017 Quake & Chaos: Odds That Rock the World

## A Cosmic Seer’s Chilling Call
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer with alien whispers, foresaw an Aegean quake, a mosque’s ruin, a deadly landslide, England’s woe, and terror’s rise—days before 2017’s chaos hit? His contact reports claim Plejaren insight, and we’re testing them with hard math. On June 10, 2017, Ptaah predicted five seismic shocks—literal and figurative. The odds defy reason; the stakes shook nations. This is Meier’s cosmic tale—and it’s here to hook you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **June 10, 2017**, Ptaah unleashed these bold forecasts:

1. **Aegean Quake**:  
   "At the beginning of next week there will be another stronger quake in the Aegean." A big shake, set for June 12, 2017.

2. **Mosul Mosque Blast**:  
   "In the next few days in…Mosul a blast attack will be carried out on the…Al-Nuri mosque and everything will be razed." An 850-year icon falls—soon, no date.

3. **Landslide Disaster**:  
   "The next one happening around the 23rd/24th of June…causing more than 150 deaths." A misnamed landslide, pegged to June 23-24, 2017.

4. **England’s Accidents**:  
   "England will be affected by serious accidents and destruction in the near future…many deaths." Shock and loss, undated.

5. **Terrorism Rises**:  
   "Terrorism is on the increase." A global surge, no timeline.

## Did Fate Follow?
- **Aegean Quake**: Spot-on. June 12, 2017—a 6.3 quake rocked the Aegean Sea (38.82°N, 26.31°E), two days after Meier’s call. Stronger than recent shakes (e.g., 4.9 on June 4), it rattled Lesbos, killed one.
- **Mosul Blast**: Nailed it. June 21, 2017—ISIS blew up the Al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul (built 1172), 11 days out. Iraqi forces neared; the minaret fell—history razed.
- **Landslide**: Dead right. June 24, 2017—a landslide in Sichuan, China, buried Xinmo village, killing 160+ (official toll unclear, estimates 150-200). Called a “landslide,” Meier’s timing hit.
- **England’s Woes**: Broadly true. June 14, 2017—Grenfell Tower fire in London killed 72, shocked the UK. “Accidents” fits; terror (June 3 London Bridge, 8 dead) adds weight—near-future chaos.
- **Terrorism Surge**: On point. 2017 saw terror spike—Westminster (March, 5 dead), Manchester (May, 22 dead), London Bridge (June, 8 dead), Barcelona (August, 13 dead)—global toll climbed.

## The Odds: A Tectonic Triumph
Pre-June 10, 2017, odds, crunched cold:

- **Aegean Quake (June 12)**:  
  - **Context**: Aegean’s active—6.3 rare.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/365 (day) × 1/10 (strong) = **1 in 3,650**.  
  - **Impact**: Lesbos shook—homes cracked.

- **Mosul Blast (Days)**:  
  - **Context**: Mosul’s war raged—blast bold.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/10 (week) × 1/20 (mosque) = **1 in 200**.  
  - **Impact**: Icon lost—Iraq mourned.

- **Landslide (June 23-24)**:  
  - **Context**: Landslides yearly—150+ deaths specific.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/180 (2 days) × 1/10 (toll) = **1 in 1,800**.  
  - **Impact**: Village gone—China grieved.

- **England’s Accidents (Soon)**:  
  - **Context**: Accidents common—scale notable.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/20 (month) × 1/5 (deaths) = **1 in 100**.  
  - **Impact**: Grenfell burned—UK stunned.

- **Terrorism Rises (2017)**:  
  - **Context**: Terror up post-2014—jump clear.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (trend) = **1 in 5**.  
  - **Impact**: Cities bled—fear spiked.

## Combined Odds: Stellar Stakes
All five: 1/3,650 × 1/200 × 1/1,800 × 1/100 × 1/5 = **1 in 657,000,000** (657 million). That’s like picking every disaster from a global hat—blind. Three exact hits anchor it—wild precision.

## Why This Hooks You
Meier called a quake two days out, Mosul’s fall 11 days early, and a landslide bang on—then saw England’s grief and terror’s grip. From 2017’s edge, he mapped chaos. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds so wild they’d fry Vegas. Science can’t dodge this: alien tip or eerie knack? Next: a pope flees Rome. Join us—this story’s shaking history.
