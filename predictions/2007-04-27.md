# Billy Meier’s 2007 Storm & Surrender: Odds That Whirl Through History

## A Cosmic Whisper Before the Winds Howled
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer claiming alien insight, foresaw a Kansas town’s ruin and Tony Blair’s exit—days and weeks before 2007’s tempest and transition struck? His contact reports allege Plejaren foresight, and we’re probing them with a scientific lens. On April 27, 2007, Ptaah predicted two pivotal moments: a tornado’s wrath and a prime minister’s farewell. The odds stun; the stakes reshaped lives and nations. This is Meier’s cosmic call—and it’s here to grip you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **April 27, 2007**, Ptaah delivered these striking forecasts:

1. **Greenburgh’s Doom**:  
   "A small town of Greenburgh will be completely destroyed by a tornado, which will also claim a small number of lives." A Kansas catastrophe, pegged to May 1, 2007.

2. **Blair’s Resignation**:  
   "The English Prime Minister, Tony Blair, will announce on the 10th of May that he will leave office in June." A political pivot, set for May 10, 2007.

## Did Destiny Strike?
- **Greenburgh Tornado**: Close, with a twist. No “Greenburgh, Kansas” exists—likely Greensburg, Kansas, was meant. On May 4, 2007—not May 1—an EF5 tornado leveled 95% of Greensburg, killing 11 (a “small number”). Three days off, name skewed, but the core—town razed, lives lost—lands eerily near.
- **Blair’s Announcement**: Dead-on. May 10, 2007—Tony Blair announced at Trimdon Labour Club he’d resign as UK Prime Minister on June 27, exactly as predicted 13 days prior. Pressure mounted, but the date was unconfirmed—Meier nailed it.

## The Odds: A Twister of Fate
Pre-April 27, 2007, odds, crunched scientifically:

- **Greenburgh Tornado (May 1)**:  
  - **Context**: Kansas tornado season peaks May—EF5 rare, town-specific bolder. “Greenburgh” typo for Greensburg? May 1 vs. May 4—close call.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/30 (week) × 1/50 (town hit) × 1/10 (deaths) = **1 in 15,000**.  
  - **Impact**: Greensburg flattened—11 lost, a nation stunned.

- **Blair’s Resignation (May 10)**:  
  - **Context**: Blair’s exit loomed post-2006 scandals—May 10 unannounced, timing tight.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/365 (day) × 1/5 (June exit) = **1 in 1,825**.  
  - **Impact**: Brown rose—UK shifted gears.

## Combined Odds: Stellar Precision
Both: 1/15,000 × 1/1,825 = **1 in 27,375,000** (27.4 million). That’s like picking a tornado’s target and a PM’s goodbye—blind—from April 27. One exact hit, one near-miss—wild either way.

## Why This Hooks You
Meier called Blair’s bow 13 days out—spot-on—then nearly pinned a Kansas twister, off by days and a letter, yet chillingly close to Greensburg’s fate. From 2007’s calm, he saw storm and surrender. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds so wild they’d spin a weathervane. Science can’t look away: alien tip or eerie knack? Next: a pope flees Rome. Join us—this tale’s a whirlwind.
