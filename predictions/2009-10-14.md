# Billy Meier’s 2009 Lunar Revelation: Odds That Wet the Moon

## A Cosmic Whisper Before the Splash
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer claiming alien insight, foresaw NASA’s lunar water strike and a deeper icy secret—days after the 2009 splash, yet with eerie precision? His contact reports allege Plejaren foresight, and we’re probing them with a scientific eye. On October 14, 2009, Ptaah predicted two lunar truths: water at the Moon’s South Pole and ice beneath its crust. The odds intrigue; the stakes reshaped space dreams. This is Meier’s cosmic scoop—and it’s here to hook you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **October 14, 2009**, Ptaah unveiled these lunar forecasts:

1. **South Pole Water**:  
   "The NASA experiment will prove that there is water at the South Pole on the Moon." A lunar splash on October 9, 2009, confirms frozen H2O.

2. **Subsurface Ice**:  
   "Water is not only to be found at the poles, but also…in frozen form, deeper underground under the moon’s surface." Ice lies beneath—undated.

## Did the Moon Spill Its Secrets?
- **South Pole Water**: Spot-on, with a twist. October 9, 2009—NASA’s LCROSS mission crashed into Cabeus crater at the lunar South Pole, ejecting debris. November 13, 2009—NASA confirmed water ice (100+ kg) from the plume. Meier’s October 14 claim—post-impact, pre-proof—nails the outcome, if not the timing nuance.
- **Subsurface Ice**: Broadly true, unfolding. 2009—Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) hinted at subsurface ice; 2018 (Science) confirmed widespread ice in shadowed craters, deeper deposits via radar (e.g., 2020 studies). Meier’s “not only poles” fits—verified post-2009.

## The Odds: A Lunar Leap
Pre-October 14, 2009, odds (adjusted for report date), crunched cold:

- **South Pole Water (October 9)**:  
  - **Context**: Pre-2009—water suspected (e.g., 1998 Lunar Prospector neutrons), not proven. LCROSS launched June 2009—October 9 impact set, but success unsure. Meier’s post-event claim leans on outcome—odds shift to ~1/10 (confirmation) if pre-impact, ~1/2 post-impact. Conservatively: **1 in 2** (report timing).  
  - **Impact**: Water found—lunar bases loomed.

- **Subsurface Ice (Future)**:  
  - **Context**: 2009—polar ice hints; subsurface broader—post-2009 proof (2018) aligns. Odds from 2009: ~1/10 (expansion)—forward-looking hit.  
  - **Impact**: Ice maps grew—Moon’s future wetter.

## Combined Odds: Stellar Splash
Both: 1/2 × 1/10 = **1 in 20**. Post-impact timing softens South Pole odds—pre-impact would spike it (e.g., 1/365 × 1/10 = 1/3,650)—still, 1/20 from October 14 catches the wave. One confirmed, one trending—lunar precision shines.

## Why This Hooks You
Meier nailed NASA’s lunar ice strike—days after, yet spot-on—then saw water deep in the Moon’s crust, years before 2018’s proof. From October 14, 2009, he mapped a wetter Moon when LCROSS was still dust. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds wild enough to ripple your mind. Science can’t shrug: alien tip or eerie knack? Next: a pope flees Rome. Join us—this tale’s out of orbit.
