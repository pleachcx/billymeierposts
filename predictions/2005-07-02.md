# Billy Meier’s 2005 Shockwave: Odds That Storm the Mind

## A Cosmic Forecast Before Chaos Struck
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer claiming alien intel, saw storms, a space smash, a hurricane, and London’s darkest day—days before they hit? His contact reports allege Plejaren visions, and we’re crunching the numbers to test their wild precision. On July 2, 2005, Ptaah predicted four events: weather havoc, a cosmic collision, a Pacific tempest, and a terror strike. The odds are unreal; the stakes shook the globe. This is Meier’s cosmic scoop—and it’s here to stun you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **July 2, 2005**, Ptaah delivered these jaw-dropping forecasts:

1. **Thunderstorms Rage**:  
   "In the coming days, from Europe to the Far East, there will again be exceptional storms…causing a lot of damage and…human lives." Severe thunderstorms, imminent, no date.

2. **Deep Impact Hits**:  
   "On Monday, the 4th of July…an American probe, called ‘Deep Impact’…will be steered close to comet ‘Temple 1’…to bring a heavy projectile to bear." A NASA feat, pegged to July 4, 2005.

3. **Pacific Hurricane**:  
   "A huge hurricane is approaching again, which will move northwards and cause much suffering and numerous deaths." A devastating Pacific storm, undated.

4. **London Bombings**:  
   "On the 7th of July, a quadruple attack by the al-Qaeda terrorist network will take place in England, in London…a bus destroyed…the Underground suffering…three other bombings." A terror strike, set for July 7, 2005.

## Did the Stars Align?
- **Thunderstorms**: Broadly true. July 2005 saw severe storms—Europe’s heatwave (France, Spain) spawned thunderstorms, killing dozens (e.g., July 9-10 floods); Far East’s Typhoon Haitang hit July 18, 42 dead. “Coming days” fits—damage and lives lost align.
- **Deep Impact**: Nailed it. On July 4, 2005, NASA’s Deep Impact probe slammed into Comet Tempel 1 at 05:52 UTC—public reveal hit that day. Launched January 2005, Meier called it two days out.
- **Hurricane**: Likely match. Hurricane Dennis formed July 4, peaked July 10—killed 89, ravaged the Caribbean and U.S. Gulf Coast, moving north. Timing and toll fit Meier’s warning.
- **London Bombings**: Dead-on. July 7, 2005—four al-Qaeda-linked suicide bombers hit London: three Underground trains, one bus. 52 dead, 700+ injured—quadruple attack, exact as predicted.

## The Odds: A Galactic Jackpot
Pre-July 2, 2005, odds, scientifically sized:

- **Thunderstorms (Days)**:  
  - **Context**: Summer storms common—Europe/Far East scale rare.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/10 (week) × 1/5 (severity) = **1 in 50**.  
  - **Impact**: Floods, deaths—weather turned killer.

- **Deep Impact (July 4)**:  
  - **Context**: Mission public since 2004—date firm by July.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/365 (day) × 1/2 (success) = **1 in 730**.  
  - **Impact**: Cracked a comet—science soared.

- **Hurricane (Soon)**:  
  - **Context**: Pacific season peaks July—big one bold.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/10 (month) × 1/5 (scale) = **1 in 50**.  
  - **Impact**: Dennis wrecked lives—$2.5 billion lost.

- **London Bombings (July 7)**:  
  - **Context**: Al-Qaeda active—specificity wild.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/365 (day) × 1/10 (quad attack) × 1/5 (London) = **1 in 18,250**.  
  - **Impact**: Shook Britain—terror’s scar endures.

## Combined Odds: Beyond the Stars
All four: 1/50 × 1/730 × 1/50 × 1/18,250 = **1 in 33,287,500** (33.3 million). That’s like nailing every lottery ticket in a storm—impossible, yet Meier hit three, grazed one. Cosmic luck?

## Why This Hooks You
Meier foresaw London’s 7/7 horror five days early, NASA’s comet crash two days out, and storms that drowned nations—when 2005 still felt calm. Dennis roared, thunder struck—three wins, one tease. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds so wild they’d fry a supercomputer. Science can’t blink: alien tip or eerie gift? Next: a pope flees Rome. Dive in—this tale’s electric.
