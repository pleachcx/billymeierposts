# Billy Meier’s 2020 COVID Call: Odds That Virus-Proof the Future

## A Cosmic Warning Before the Plague Peaked
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer claiming alien intel, saw COVID-19’s toll, governmental flops, and economic panic unfolding—weeks before the world reeled? His contact reports allege Plejaren foresight, and we’re testing them with raw math. On March 15, 2020, Ptaah predicted six chilling outcomes: millions infected, resurgent waves, and a false dawn. The odds defy chance; the stakes hit home. This is Meier’s cosmic scoop—and it’s here to hook you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **March 15, 2020**, Ptaah dropped these stark forecasts:

1. **COVID’s April Toll**:  
   "The number of people infected by the virus will be in the millions and the death toll in the hundreds of thousands by the end of April." A dire spike by April 30, 2020.

2. **Resurgence Ahead**:  
   "The state of infections and deaths will increase again." Lifting restrictions too soon fuels a comeback—no date.

3. **Leaders Buckle**:  
   "The leaders of many countries will irrationally and irresponsibly give in to the demands of the economy." Economic pressure trumps caution—undated.

4. **Pandemic Runs Wild**:  
   "The pandemic will develop and is now rampant." Governmental inaction lets it spread—no timeline.

5. **Financial Collapse Looms**:  
   "The economic powers will see a financial collapse which they are beginning to recognise as imminent." A crash nears—undated.

6. **False Relief**:  
   "The great danger has been averted." People will wrongly think the worst is over—no date.

## Did the Plague Prove Him Right?
- **April Toll**: Nailed it. By April 30, 2020, WHO reported 3.1 million cases and 217,000 deaths—millions infected, hundreds of thousands dead, spot-on from March 15’s 167,000 cases, 6,600 deaths.
- **Resurgence**: Dead right. May-June 2020 saw U.S., Europe relax—cases spiked by July (e.g., U.S. daily cases hit 77,000). Waves kept coming—2021’s Delta proved it.
- **Leaders Buckle**: Bang-on. Trump pushed reopenings April 2020, EU nations (e.g., UK, Spain) eased by May—economy over health, infections soared.
- **Pandemic Rampant**: True enough. March 2020 inaction (e.g., U.S. testing lags) let COVID rip—3.1 million cases by April grew to 10 million by November.
- **Financial Collapse**: Close call. March 2020 saw markets crash—Dow dropped 37% by March 23—leaders saw doom, but stimulus staved off total collapse.
- **False Relief**: Eerily apt. By May 2020, U.S. crowds hit beaches, UK pubs reopened July—many thought “it’s over,” fueling waves.

## The Odds: A Viral Victory
Pre-March 15, 2020, odds, crunched cold:

- **April Toll (April 30)**:  
  - **Context**: 167,000 cases—millions bold, deaths on pace.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/30 (month) × 1/5 (scale) = **1 in 150**.  
  - **Impact**: Millions locked down—graves filled fast.

- **Resurgence (Later)**:  
  - **Context**: Lockdowns new—rebound plausible.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (relaxation) × 1/2 (spike) = **1 in 10**.  
  - **Impact**: Waves killed more—Delta hit hard.

- **Leaders Buckle (Soon)**:  
  - **Context**: Economy screamed—rash moves likely.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (pressure) = **1 in 5**.  
  - **Impact**: Shops opened, cases climbed—policy faltered.

- **Pandemic Rampant (2020)**:  
  - **Context**: March chaos—inaction clear.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (spread) = **1 in 5**.  
  - **Impact**: Masks, fear—world shut down.

- **Financial Collapse (2020)**:  
  - **Context**: Markets wobbled—crash talk rife.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/10 (recognition) = **1 in 10**.  
  - **Impact**: Jobs vanished—stimulus barely held.

- **False Relief (Soon)**:  
  - **Context**: Hope flared mid-2020—negligence followed.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (denial) = **1 in 5**.  
  - **Impact**: Crowds bred variants—danger lingered.

## Combined Odds: Pandemic Precision
All six: 1/150 × 1/10 × 1/5 × 1/5 × 1/10 × 1/5 = **1 in 375,000**. That’s like calling every twist of 2020’s nightmare—blind. One hit alone staggers—six seal it.

## Why This Hooks You
Meier saw COVID’s April carnage six weeks out—then nailed leaders’ flops, economic dread, and our dumb relief. From 167,000 cases to millions, he called it. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds so wild they’d crash a crystal ball. Science can’t shrug this off: alien tip or eerie knack? Next: a pope flees Rome. Join us—this tale’s alive.
