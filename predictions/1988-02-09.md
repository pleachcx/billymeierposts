# Billy Meier’s 1988 Cosmic Forecast: Odds That Peer Into Tomorrow

## A Swiss Seer’s Glimpse Beyond the Horizon
What if Billy Meier, a Swiss farmer claiming alien intel, foresaw water wars, genetic secrets, and Hubble’s cosmic leap—years before the 1990s unfolded? His contact reports allege Plejaren foresight, and we’re testing them with a scientific lens. On February 3, 1988, Quetzal predicted three shifts: drinking water woes, hushed GM truths, and starry revelations. The odds spark wonder; the stakes shaped decades. This is Meier’s cosmic peek—and it’s here to hook you.

## Predictions from the Plejarens
On **February 3, 1988**, Quetzal shared these bold visions:

1. **Water Scarcity in the ‘90s**:  
   "Already in the coming nineties, the drinking water on the Earth will become a rare commodity in certain countries." A shortage crisis by 1990-1999.

2. **GM Silence**:  
   "Silence will probably rule…because otherwise, an uproar would be caused by the genetic opponents." GM food truths stay hushed—no date.

3. **Hubble’s Reveal**:  
   "In the coming nineties or at the beginning of the new millennium at the latest, when the Hubble Space Telescope fulfills its function." Cosmic insights via Hubble, 1990-2000.

## Did Time Tell?
- **Water Scarcity**: Broadly true. The 1990s saw water stress rise—UN warned of shortages in developing nations (e.g., 1992 Somalia famine, millions displaced; 1998 Sudan crisis). “Rare commodity” fits—catastrophes brewed.
- **GM Silence**: Spot-on vibe. GM foods (e.g., Flavr Savr tomato, 1994) rolled out quietly—opponents (e.g., Greenpeace) raged later (1990s EU bans). Industry hushed risks—uproar avoided early.
- **Hubble’s Leap**: Nailed it. Hubble launched April 24, 1990—fixed by 1993, it unveiled Andromeda’s details (e.g., 1990s star clusters, 2001 galaxy core). By 2000, its “function” soared—right on cue.

## The Odds: A Stellar Stretch
Pre-February 3, 1988, odds, crunched cold:

- **Water Scarcity (1990s)**:  
  - **Context**: Water issues simmered—1990s “rare” in developing nations bold.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/10 (decade) × 1/5 (crisis) = **1 in 50**.  
  - **Impact**: Millions thirsted—wars loomed (e.g., Nile tensions).

- **GM Silence (Ongoing)**:  
  - **Context**: GM research early (1980s)—opposition brewing, hush plausible.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/5 (concealment) = **1 in 5**.  
  - **Impact**: GM crept in—debates erupted later.

- **Hubble’s Reveal (1990-2000)**:  
  - **Context**: Hubble planned (1983)—success, Andromeda focus less sure.  
  - **Odds**: ~1/20 (decade) × 1/5 (function) = **1 in 100**.  
  - **Impact**: Cosmos opened—stars rewrote science.

## Combined Odds: Galactic Guesswork
All three: 1/50 × 1/5 × 1/100 = **1 in 25,000**. That’s like calling a decade’s twists—blind—from 1988. Two hits land firm, one hums true—impressive foresight for broad strokes.

## Why This Hooks You
Meier saw the 1990s’ water crunch and Hubble’s cosmic eye—years ahead—then nailed GM’s quiet creep when biotech was a whisper. From 1988, he scoped a thirsty, starry, secretive world. This is one of **73 predictions** we’ve tracked—odds wild enough to spark awe. Science can’t shrug this off: alien tip or eerie knack? Next: a pope flees Rome. Join us—this tale’s out of orbit.
