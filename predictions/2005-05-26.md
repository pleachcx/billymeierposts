# Billy Meier’s 2005 Cosmic Call: The EU Constitution Rejection and Continental Shift

## A Cosmic Warning from the Heart of Europe  
In 2005, Billy Meier’s contact reports delivered a bold forecast on the future of European integration. Ptaah predicted that the proposed EU Constitution would be rejected—a move that would not only upend the project but also send ripples across the continent. He foresaw that France would lead the charge, with the Netherlands following suit, and that this rejection would inflict a major setback on the European Union. History confirms these events, and today we break down the probabilities behind this cosmic call.

## The Forecasts and Their Outcomes

1. **EU Constitution Rejection**  
   *Prediction*: “The EU Constitution will be rejected.”  
   *Outcome*: In May 2005, referendums in France (May 29) and the Netherlands (June 1) decisively rejected the treaty, halting the momentum for deeper constitutional reform.  
   *Estimated Odds*: **1 in 3**

2. **France Leads the Rejection**  
   *Prediction*: “France will be in the first place in this respect, because the rationality of the majority of the people will prevail.”  
   *Outcome*: France indeed became the first country to reject the EU Constitution, setting the tone for the subsequent outcome.  
   *Estimated Odds*: **1 in 2**

3. **The Netherlands Follows Suit**  
   *Prediction*: “The Netherlands will follow suit and give the EU another setback.”  
   *Outcome*: Shortly after France’s decision, the Netherlands also rejected the Constitution, compounding the setback for the EU’s ambitions.  
   *Estimated Odds*: **1 in 2**

4. **A Bitter Setback for the EU**  
   *Prediction*: “By rejecting the Constitution, the European Union is suffering a very bitter, even a huge setback.”  
   *Outcome*: The rejection forced the EU to abandon its constitutional project, marking a significant—but transformative—moment in European politics.  
   *Estimated Odds*: **1 in 3**

## Combined Cosmic Odds  
Focusing on these interconnected forecasts, the overall probability of this entire scenario unfolding by chance can be estimated as:  

- **Combined Odds**:  
  1/3 (Constitution rejected) × 1/2 (France leads) × 1/2 (Netherlands follows) × 1/3 (EU setback) = **1 in 36**.

This means that if each element were an independent chance event, the odds of this specific sequence happening were about 1 in 36—a remarkably low probability for such a pivotal political shift.

## Why This Cosmic Call Hooks You  
Billy Meier’s 2005 predictions challenge us to reconsider the role of foresight in historical events. The rejection of the EU Constitution—led by France and quickly joined by the Netherlands—was not only a political turning point but also a cosmic puzzle that defied conventional odds. This extraordinary alignment of events invites you to delve deeper into the mysteries of prediction and chance, and to explore how seemingly improbable events can shape our collective future.
